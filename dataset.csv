Consumed by hatred for the living, Nhagruul sold his soul to the demon Lords of the abyss so that his malign spirit would survive. In an excruciating ritual, Nhagrulls skin was flayed into pages, his bones hammered into a cover, and his diseased blood became the ink to pen a book most vile. All those exposed to the book were driven to madness or so corrupted by the wicked knowledge contained within that they had no choice but to turn evil. Misery and bloodshed followed the disciples of Nhagruul as they spread their Masters dark dream. Creatures vile and depraved rose from every pit and unclean barrow to partake in the fever of destruction. The cities and kingdoms of Karkoth were consumed by this plague of evil until an order of warriors arose from the ashes. The Knights of the New Sun swore an oath to resurrect hope in the land. The purity of their hearts was so great that Pelor, the God of Light, gave the Knights powerful amulets with which to channel his power. Transcendent with divine might, the Knights of the New Sun pierced the shadow that had darkened the land for twelve hundred years and cast it asunder. But not all were awed by their glory. The disciples of Nhagruul disassembled the book and bribed three greedy souls to hide the pieces until they could be retrieved. The ink was discovered and destroyed but, despite years of searching, the cover and pages were never found. Peace ruled the land for centuries and the Knights got lost in the light of their own glory. As memory of the awful events faded so did the power of servants of Pelor. They unwittingly abandoned themselves in the incorrect belief that the Book of Vile Darkness could never again be made whole.",90,2063,4.5

As usual, she is expecting Heather to come home for the holidays from Boston, where she is going to school.

And Charles is having problems meeting deadlines for his latest novel and needs somewhere quiet and out of the way to complete his writing.

In Boston, Emily learns upon her arrival that Heather has left town with her boyfriend, Jason, Heather who seems to be trying to test her adult wings without Emily's influence. But Emily meets Ray, the two who slowly fall for each other. They will have to determine both their professional and personal futures past this week, and if the other person factors into that future.

Out of circumstance, Faith is forced to stay at the house with Charles for the better part of the week.

Scientists from 80 nations have simulated the Big Bang with the so-called 'God Machine', the world's greatest particle accelerator, and thereby created a Black Hole. Reaching Geneva turns into a tour de force for our heroes, through a country that like its neighbors is in a state of total emergency, but equally into a time of human encounters. A time, where courage overcomes the fear and human beings do not shut themselves off but take decisive action. A time, where the end is a beginning, and where two brothers become soul mates again. A time, where weakness turns into strength and individuals are unified into a single nation. A time, where despair turns into hope, and loneliness into the love of a lifetime. A time, where one look says more than a thousand words, and even the smallest individuals become giants. Europe's darkest hour turns into a time of patriotic heroes. Heroes just like you and me...",143,576,2.0

Mikey, now known as MIKE TAYLOR, is in the Studio waiting to lay down the new tracks, when MATTY MCPHERSON, strikingly young and beautiful, introduces herself as the new demo singer. As she begins to sing, there is an immediate attraction between Mike and Matty, who is not only gorgeous and young, but a brilliant artist. Matty follows Mike back to his hotel and seduces him, which is reminiscent of his exciting ""groupie"" rock and roll days. He immediately becomes smitten with the very young and beautiful Matty, but tells himself this affair will pass as soon as the album is finished. The problem is, Mike can not finish the album without Matty, who truly inspires him, but who also leads him back down the road of destruction by encouraging him to relive his days of alcohol, drugs and sex abuse. Matty tells Mike she is his new addiction and convinces him he cannot succeed without her. As weeks go by, Mike is filled with the expected guilt of a cheating husband, but the more he tries to get away from Matty, the more she tempts him back with a new song she has written. To celebrate, she offers more booze, drugs and erotic sex; taking Mike deeper into the dark side: closer to Matty but further from Joyce. Mike's friends encourage him to go to the police, citing she is a stalker who is out to destroy him, but when he tries, the police take Matty's side, who convinces the police she is pregnant with Mike's child. To retaliate Matty kidnaps Joyce, and invites Mike to ""save Joyce, or succumb to me"". Will Mike be able to save Joyce from the evil web of Matty, or succumb to his addiction as he has so many times before with the beautiful Matty?",91,451,3.9

Beginning with that fateful day, 15 April 1989, the film details the horror of the tragedy, told through the experiences of those directly involved: fans, survivors, family members and police officers. Many speak publicly for the first time. It captures the horror of the crush on the terraces, revealing the prejudices held by the police towards football fans. It exposes the police commanders' abject failure in leadership as the tragedy unfolded, and their deceit and determination to deflect responsibility for their failures in crowd management onto those who survived. The documentary exposes the lack of dignity shown to bereaved families as they arrived in Sheffield to identify their loved ones laid out in body bags on a gymnasium floor. It considers the impact of the orchestrated vilification of fans in the media and, as a consequence, their public condemnation. By interviewing those involved, it recounts the 27-year campaign for justice fought on behalf of the 96 who died.",121,377,8.7

Marx Reloaded,2011,Documentary,marxism|philosophy|2d-animation|communism,"Marx Reloaded is a cultural documentary that examines the relevance of German socialist and philosopher Karl Marx's ideas for understanding the global economic and financial crisis of 2008-09. The crisis triggered the deepest global recession in 70 years and prompted the US government to spend more than 1 trillion dollars in order to rescue its banking system from collapse. Today the full implications of the crisis in Europe and around the world still remain unclear. Nevertheless, should we accept the crisis as an unfortunate side-effect of the free market? Or is there another explanation as to why it happened and its likely effects on our society, our economy and our whole way of life? Written and directed by Jason Barker - himself an experienced writer, lecturer, translator and doctor of philosophy - Marx Reloaded comprises interviews with the world's leading philosophers of Marxism, including those at the forefront of a popular revival in Marxist and communist ideas. The film also includes interviews with skeptics of this revival as well as light-hearted animation sequences which follow Marx's adventures through the matrix of his own ideas.",52,273,6.5

To penetrate these organizations and gain access to their inner circles the police need a magic bullet. Alex Caine is that magic bullet. Only thirty years old, Alex, who grew up hard on the mean streets of Montreal, already brings a lifetime's worth of experience (foster care, military service, prison time) to the world's most dangerous occupation: professional gang infiltrator. It is his job to befriend criminals, participate in their illegal activities, gather evidence - then live long enough to testify against them in court. Inspired by real-life events, Befriend and Betray tells the story of Alex's first infiltration assignment - the case that transformed him from a rootless young man into a highly effective, defiantly unconventional crime-fighting resource. Approached by P.C. Lau, a ruthlessly ambitious soldier for the Kam Tin Triad, Alex is asked to help his old prison acquaintance with a business proposition. Since Alex comes from Montreal and speaks French, P.C. figures he's just the man to be the face of the Kam Tin as they try to move their heroin into eastern Canada. What P.C. doesn't realize is that Alex has been approached by the police and Criminal Intelligence Services who've asked him to say ""yes"" to P.C.'s proposal - thus giving them a long sought-after way into the Kam Tin. Complicating matters for Alex is the fact that his girlfriend Melanie has no idea that he's agreed to work for the police. Alex figures that the less she knows, the safer she'll be. Trouble is, the more he lies to protect her, the more likely he is to lose the one person who sees him as more than just a valuable crime-fighting asset. Combining action, suspense, humour and actual details drawn from the case files of Alex Caine, Befriend and Betray tells the story of one man's re-birth as an infiltrator - and his struggle not to lose his identity or his life along the way.",85,105,5.0

The Pendle Witch Child,2011,Documentary|History,witch|f-rated,"Simon Armitage presents the extraordinary story of the most disturbing witch trial in British history and the key role played in it by one nine-year-old girl. Jennet Device, a beggar-girl from Pendle in Lancashire, was the star witness in the trial in 1612 of her own mother, her brother, her sister and many of her neighbours and, thanks to her chilling testimony, they were all hanged. In 'The Pendle Witch Child' poet Simon Armitage explores the lethal power and influence of one child's words - a story of fear, magic and demonic pacts retold partly with vivid and innovative hand-drawn animation. He discovers how Jennet's appearance in the witness box cast its shadow way beyond Lancashire, impressing lawyers, politicians, clerics and even the King himself and setting a dark precedent for child testimony in witch trials as far away as America. Finally, in a dramatic twist to the tale, he reveals how, 22 years after the original trial, Jennet's own words were very nearly the death of her - when she herself was put on trial, accused of being a witch by a 10-year-old boy. With the help of historians Malcolm Gaskill, Diane Purkiss and Ronald Hutton, Simon Armitage attempts to get inside Jennet's head and understand how the illegitimate and illiterate youngest child of a family of beggars could become both pawn and player in a much bigger story of 17th century religion, power, law, science and the monarchy. What made Jennet speak out so everyone she knew would die? And how did the courts decide to admit her evidence, and allow her example to create a precedent for accepting the testimony of other child witnesses who wanted to send their neighbours to the gallows? Although the events in this film may date back four hundred years, its issues resonate today as much as ever - when to believe our children, how the police and the court system should handle child witnesses and above all how, in times of crisis, fear of evil can easily lead us to behave in ways which may corrode the very values that we most wish to protect.",60,48,6.9

He wanted to stage a live Pan-European singing competition to promote the nascent television services of Western Europe, and bring the divided nations of a war-torn Europe closer together in a shared celebration of music. The first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland, on 24th May 1956. Just seven countries took part (six of whom, significantly, went on to sign the Treaty of Rome and lay the foundations of the European Community) but it was an instant hit and has become an unbroken annual fixture in the life of the continent. But it came to mean even more than that. During the Cold War, the glitz and glamour on the Eurovision stage was seen as a symbol of Western fun and freedom. Only a very few in the Eastern bloc were able or brave enough to risk their lives by tuning in to Finnish TV signals in secret. In recent decades, following the fall of the Iron Curtain and breakup of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, new nations have clamoured to take part, injecting new life into the contest and raising the political stakes yet further by seeing it as a rare opportunity to promote their national identity on an international stage. Today, the Eurovision Song Contest is one of the most-watched broadcast events in the world, attracting hundreds of millions of fans across Europe and as far afield as Australasia, Asia and Latin America. Some love it, some laugh at it, some are obsessed by it, but most think of the Eurovision Song Contest as just a great night's entertainment. And yet it has slowly become one of the great popular cultural festivals of our age, a carnival of fun and frivolity that can be taken -- in a certain light -- as a symbol of just how far Europe has travelled since Monsieur Bescancon had his brainwave.",55,41,7.5

This covers governmental, civil, military, judicial, financial, medical, manufacturing and shipping, commercial, and other aspects of support and recovery. The main scenario is an EMP blast that knocks out the power grid and also a nuclear blast on Washington D.C. and the surrounding area. What areas would be affected, what the immediate effects are and the systems in place that would work to mitigate any damage and speed recovery and thwart a future attack. It is not sensationalized, just folks in leadership positions planning for ""what if?"" possible scenarios. Definitely worth a viewing, then you can do your part in preparing yourself and family for the possibilities in case of a disaster. The government does not build shelters like it did in and after WWII, nor has it kept up with modernizing them, so it is up to you to seek and find suitable shelters when you are out and about or at home. It is good to know that some form of disaster scenario planning has taken place, and there are systems in place to help with recovery, although this recovery may be minimal.

The characters are vivid: aside from Dr. Rambelli, a gentleman who lent himself to medicine, there is Elsa, the woman of the people full of sensuality and primitive charm, whom the lead character falls in love with, questioning his own marriage relationship; Bellenghi, the federal ignoramus, bossy and violent, symbol of local power and muscular Fascist squad member; Giuseppe, a sensitive, solitary, intelligent child, capable of seeing dead people.

We reveal who made them and why. Etched, as if by giants, onto the arid moonscape of Peru's southern desert lies one of man's greatest mysteries; the Nasca Lines. More than 15,000 geometric and animal-like patterns have been discovered criss-crossing the pampas like a vast puzzle. Who built them and what was their purpose? Ancient racetracks, landing strips for aliens, or perhaps a giant astronomical calendar? And are the Lines connected to the gruesome discovery of large cache's of severed human heads. Now, after decades of misunderstanding, modern archaeology may finally have the answer. Excavations in the surrounding mountains are uncovering extraordinary clues about the people who made them and why. A long since vanished people, called the Nasca, flourished here between 200BC and 700AD. But the harsh environment led them to extreme measures in order to survive. Archaeologist Christina Conlee recently made an extraordinary find: the skeleton of a young male, ceremonially buried but showing gruesome evidence of decapitation. In place of the missing human head, a ceramic ""head jar"" decorated with a striking image of a decapitated head with a tree sprouting from its skull. Conlee wonders who this person was? Why was he beheaded and yet buried with honor. Was he a captive taken in battle, or could he have been a willing sacrifice? And did his decapitation have anything to do with the lines? The discovery of large caches of human heads adds grisly weight to Conlee's theories and helps unravel on of man's great mysteries.",47,33,6.6

How Police Missed the Grindr Killer,2017,Documentary,gay|drugs|overdose|murder|killer,"The story of how police repeatedly allowed a serial murderer to slip through their fingers. Stephen Port date-raped and murdered four young gay men in East London within fifteen months and dumped all four bodies within a few hundred metres of each other. Yet Barking and Dagenham police failed to link the deaths, until weeks after the fourth one. The film tells the story through eyes of the families of Port's victims, unpicking how the police failed to properly investigate each of the deaths in turn. The police's assumptions that these young gay men had died from self-inflicted overdoses of chem-sex drugs allowed Port to continue raping and killing innocent young men. The film unravels Port's sinister character and modus operandi. Port was motivated by a desire to satisfy his lust for abusive drug fuelled sexual encounters. He found all his victims through gay dating and social media sites, using multiple online profiles. Barking and Dagenham police's failings have led to huge anger amongst the families of Port's victims. Some have accused the police of institutional homophobia, and asked if officers would have investigated more thoroughly, had four young women turned up dead within such a small radius. The Met police have referred themselves to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over their handling of the case and will not comment on specific allegations until the IPCC investigation is complete.",46,24,6.8

Anna Bolena,2011,Drama|History,tudor|anne-boleyn|live-performance|italian-opera|opera,"In the summer of 1830 the impresarios of Teatro Carcano contacted Donizetti and asked him to compose a new opera for the season's opening. At the moment of signing the contract Donizetti still ignored the subject of the new opera; but he knew that the librettist would be Felice Romani and the female protagonist Giuditta Pasta. Success was resounding and unanimous, also with the critics. Donizetti had indeed reached artistic maturity. Anna Bolena tells of a human drama of solitude and oppression; it is a work of psychological introspection centred. Donizetti's first great scene of madness is one of the most moving and powerful of the whole history of opera. The new theatrical element introduced by Anna Bolena is that the protagonist's death is not a consequence of moral duty or divine justice, but a plain act of cruelty. A tragedy through and through, then: intense, deep and profoundly romantic. Anna Bolena is a very significant work in the history of opera, as well as in Donizetti's own personal history. In this Teatro Donizetti di Bergamo production Dimitra Theodossiou stands out as a fine interpreter both as a singer and as an actress.",182,22,8.5

Gianni does believe there is a way for the family to inherit Buoso's estate, albeit in a less than legal way. Buoyed by this possibility, each of Buoso's family members not only want their part of the inheritance, but most specifically the most universally coveted items of the mule, the Florence house, and the mills in Signa, which each person tries to entice Gianni to give to him/her. Each of the family members will not only see if Gianni is good to his word of being able to change the will without the collective being caught in fraud, but if he/she will be the lucky recipient of those most coveted items.",60,16,5.8

The Pretenders: Live in London,2010,Music,live-performance|concert-film,"""Live In London"" is a live performance masterpiece that captures The Pretenders at the top of their game. If you saw them live on their 2009 tour, you'll know what I'm talking about. You owe it to yourself to get this program as a reminder of just how amazing this band is on the road. ""Live In London"" succeeds where The Pretenders' studio albums fail. They are one of those rare bands that truly does sound better when they're playing in front of an audience -- an intimate small theater crowd here. With all due respect to original guitarist James Honeyman Scott and bassist Pete Farndon, The Pretenders latest lineup is the best Chrissie Hynde has ever staged. With the steady pounding of original drummer Martin Chambers, newcomers James Walbourne on guitar, Nick Wilkinson on bass and Eric Heywood on pedal steel rock from start to finish, revitalizing Pretenders' classics like ""Message of Love"" and ""Kid,"" while adding new ones like ""Boots of Chinese Plastic"" to the playlist. You'll be blown away by Walbourne's electrifying guitar work. It starts with the first licks of the opener ""Chinese Plastic,"" scorches through ""Rosalee,"" and climaxes with the show-stopper ""Precious."" Walbourne delivers pure, unadulterated, raw, rip-snorting rock 'n' roll. His on-stage chemistry with Hynde is self-evident. As per usual, Hynde's vocals are impeccable, showing great range, dynamics and emotion, equally adept at punk rockers like ""The Wait"" and ballads like ""I'll Stand By You."" This woman has earned the right to work the stage with the swagger of a rock star. She is it. The direction and camera work throughout ""Live In London"" give the viewer the perspective of being on stage with The Pretenders. Tight crops interspersed with effective wide angles make one feel like he can count the streaks of mascara multiplying on Hynde's face and see the beads of sweat building on Chambers' brow as the night rocks on.",95,15,7.5

Trumpland: Kill All Normies,2017,Documentary,alt-right,"Based on Angela Nagle's acclaimed book, Kill All Normies, Fusion's feature documentary, Trumpland: Kill All Normies, traces the white supremacist ""alt-right"" movement to its origins in obscure online subcultures populated by sexually frustrated young men. The film investigates the ""pickup artist"" industry, in which self-proclaimed ""alpha males"" teach ""betas"" how to coax women into sleeping with them, the ""incel"" community, composed of ""involuntarily celibate"" men who vent their rage at women, liberals and mainstream society on online message boards, and the ""Gamergate"" phenomenon, in which mobs of online misogynists harassed feminist game critics and developers for years. These online communities and events were characterized by a culture of ""trolling,"" in which anonymous internet posters engaged in collective online abuse of people who espoused feminist or multicultural values, often hiding behind a posture of irony. When Trump announced his candidacy, all of these online currents coalesced into a vast army of internet trolls devoted to their anointed leader's crusade against ""political correctness."" Soon after Trump's election victory, some of these trolls stepped away from their keyboards and into real physical space, dropping any pretense of irony and declaring their allegiance to a genocidal ideology of white ethno-nationalism. In August of 2017, this new racist movement erupted in a violent, murderous confrontation with counterprotestors in the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia.",43,14,6.4

The documentary film MOON TV - GOODBYE TELEVISION tells the amazing story of the Finnish underground and very anarchistic television channel Moon TV and it's struggle against the harsh business-driven media world. For six years Moon TV showed us that also television can be an alternative and independent media outlet. Youth, music and lifestyle channel Moon TV burnt with a flamboyant flame from 1997 to 2003. Starting as an humble chat and text message -based local channel, it became in the end a nationwide, respectable, cable channel. Moon TV was the youth's rebellion against the old ways of making television. In the tale of Moon TV there is truly all kinds of stories. The channel was known mostly for it's extravagant ways: it's often totally drunk channel VJ:s , it's porn film reviews, it's in-your-face attitude. Everything was covered that happened to interest the personnel: programs of punk, techno, heavy metal music, about big machines, different types of alcohols, computer games etc. One of the most celebrated program types were the ""documentations"" of different music festivals, mostly consisting of very drunk VJ:s interviewing very drunk festival goers. Although the channel was known for it's crazy antics, at the same time it was very street-wise. Nearly all of the personnel were under 25 years old and the VJ:s really know about their subjects, many of them deeply immersed into the scene which they were covering. In the end the venture company behind Moon TV got fed up with the heavily money-loosing channel. As the very marginal channel didn't get enough viewers, it was pressured to change it direction to please the greater audience. This was already to late as the channel had been hemorrhaging money from the beginning. So to the utter shock of the workers, the channel was shut down in the summer of 2003",60,12,7.4

Jandamarra's War,2011,Documentary,aboriginal|guerilla-war|culture|rebellion|power|warrior|revenge|ancient-land|colonisation,"In Jandamarra's War, we learn how in the 1890's the European colonialists arrive in the Kimberley with vast herds of sheep and cattle, determined to make their fortune by feeding a rapidly growing population in the South. But the settlers soon discover they are in land populated with indigenous tribes, ready to fight the red-faced invaders. Jandamarra is born into this turmoil in 1873. His spirit country, on his father's side, is a land called Djumbud. His mother Jinny, a powerful and independent woman, belongs to the Lennard River flat lands. At the age of six, Jinny takes Jandamarra onto William Lukin's million-acre cattle station at Lennard River Flats. Jandamarra quickly excels in all pastoral skills - much to the pride of Lukin who, like other settlers, boasts about his stockmen's abilities as tribute to his own skills of tutelage and management. Jandamarra remains at Lennard River Flats until it is time for him to be initiated into Bunuba law. His uncle Ellemarra is a very powerful influence during this period of intense education and rapid personal growth. But Jandamarra's passage into manhood is interrupted when they are both arrested and jailed for spearing a sheep. When he is released from custody, Jandamarra is banished from Bunuba society because sexual relationships he has had with various women, have broken strict kinship rules. With nowhere else to go, Jandamarra is assimilated into settler culture and ends up working with Constable Richardson who is, himself, an outsider in his own community. Their relationship is a strange one and oddly close - until that fateful night when Jandamarra kills Richardson, and returns to his people. Now fugitives, Jandamarra, Ellemarra and others attack a party of stockmen who are driving a large herd of cattle into the heart of Bunuba land. Two of the white men, Burke and Gibbs, are killed. This is the first time that guns are used by Aboriginals against European settlers in an organised fashion. Across Western Australia, enraged white colonialists bay for vengeance. A posse of 30 heavily armed police and settlers attack Jandamarra, Ellemarra and their followers at Windjana Gorge. In the ensuing battle, Ellemarra is killed and Jandamarra is seriously wounded, but escapes through a labyrinth of caves. Jandamarra recovers and leads a guerilla war against the settlers from hideouts in the caves and surrounding ranges of Windjana Gorge and Tunnel Creek. But the rebellion comes at a very high price as police and station owners embark on a military-style operation against Aboriginal camps throughout the region. Many Aboriginal people are killed in the massacres that ensue. Jandamarra responds by modifying his tactics. He doesn't kill any more settlers but embarks on a three year terror campaign - killing stock and stealing provisions from under the settlers' noses at night - deliberately leaving behind footmarks and other traces that tell the settlers that he's been there and could have killed them very easily, if he had wanted to. The police try to pursue Jandamarra after his raids but he always seems to find a way to elude capture.",55,10,7.8

But does the problem lie with the individual or the machine? Ka-Ching! goes inside the machine to find out, speaking with the masterminds behind their design, plus neuroscientists, anthropologists, game theorists and more. Australia has rapidly become the pokies capital of the world, with five times more machines per capita than the USA. Australian's are losing a staggering $19 billion a year, but everyone - players, industry and government - are hooked. What is it that makes these machines uniquely addictive? Ka-Ching! delves behind the flashing lights and spinning reels to find out what makes these machines so treacherous, leading one expert to call them the ""crack cocaine of gambling"". We speak exclusively to the masterminds behind the machine, who reveal how carefully they program pokies for addiction. It is no accident that these machines are now listed alongside cocaine and heroin in the 'psychiatric Bible', the DSM. What we find is a highly organised network of mathematicians, musicians and designers, working together on a single vision: to make sure you lose, and keep on losing. We also hear from Pokies victims themselves, who've fallen prey to what they describe as an 'unlawful hypnotism'. They let us in on the psychological lure of the machines, describing an escapist 'zone' where the stresses of the outside world disappear.",55,9,8.1
